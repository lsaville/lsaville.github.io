<h1>Fabrication with Faker</h1>

<h3>For those times when you want your tests looking good...</h3>
<p>
  You might reach out to use factory girl because it's familiar. That makes sense. I felt the same way. Recently I worked to overcome that to learn a bit more about fabrication and what its all about. I'll share with you what I found.

<p>
  Check out fabrication at it's slick website <link href="https://www.fabricationgem.org/">fabrication.org</link> or on <link href="https://github.com/paulelliott/fabrication">github</link>. The setup is very familiar if you've dealt with factory girl, just toss the line in your gemfile and make a a sub-folder "fabricators" in your rails project's spec folder. <img src="/images/gemfile.png" alt="lines from sample gemfile" /><br> From there you can create a file called "fabricator.rb" where the actual magic happens.
